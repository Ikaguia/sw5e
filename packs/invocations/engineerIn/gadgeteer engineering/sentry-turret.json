      "value": "<p>You learn how to craft small sentry turrets shaped like globes that can adhere to any surface. As an action or bonus action (your choice), you can throw a sentry to a point you can see within range (30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5). At the end of each of your turns, a deployed sentry automatically targets a hostile creature within 10 feet of it. If multiple targets are available, one is chosen at random. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes [[/r 1d4]] energy damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of your next turn. If a creature would be targeted by more than one of these sentries, it only makes this saving throw once, taking an additional [[/r d4]] damage for each sentry beyond the first.</p>\n<p>The sentries have 1 hit point, an armor class of 10, and can be repaired over the course of a long rest. Each sentry lasts for 1 minute before deactivating. You can maintain a number of sentries equal to your Intelligence modifier. Once a sentry has been activated, it can't be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
