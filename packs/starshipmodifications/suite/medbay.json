It can be revitalized over a 6-hour period. At the end of the 6 hours, the creature recovers 1 hit point, all mortal wounds close, and the creature can now recover hit points and reduce exhaustion as described above. The revitalized creature takes a -4 penalty to all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. Every time the creature finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs. Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes refitting.</p>",
