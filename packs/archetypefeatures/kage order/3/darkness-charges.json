      "value": "<p><em><strong>Kage Order:</strong> 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You learn to create a number of small charges that create enhanced darkness. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create two charges. You can create an additional charge at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Your charges can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.</p>\n<p>Once per turn, when you would make a weapon attack or unarmed strike, you can instead throw one of your charges. Your charges have a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. You can throw a device at a point you can see within range. The charges create a pocket of darkness in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on that point. The darkness spreads around corners. It lasts for 1 minute or until an enhanced source of bright light dispells it.</p>",
