      "value": "<p><em><strong>Demolitions Specialist:</strong> 3rd, 7th, and 15th level</em></p>\n<p>You learn to create a number of small explosives known as charges. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create a number of charges equal to your Intelligence modifier. You must have a demolitions kit in order to create these charges. Your charges can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.</p>\n<p>Once per turn, when you would make a ranged weapon attack, you can instead throw one of your charges. Your charges have a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. You can throw a charge at a point you can see within range. Each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier). A creature takes [[/r 2d4]] + your Intelligence modifier kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. </p>\n<p>The damage of your charges increases to [[/r 3d4]] at 7th level and [[/r 4d4]] at 15th level.</p>",
