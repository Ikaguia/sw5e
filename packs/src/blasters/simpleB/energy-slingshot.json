A power cell fuels a number of attacks equal to the weapon's reload number.</p>\n<h3>Disruptive</h3>\n<p>When a creature is forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration due to taking damage from a weapon with the disruptive property, the DC for the check equals 10 or the full damage taken, whichever number is higher, instead of only half.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property does not fill the hand, but you can't use the weapon while the hand is full. Additionally, you have a +10 bonus to ability checks and saving throws to avoid being disarmed of this weapon.</p>\n<h3>Mighty</h3>\n<p>When making an attack with a mighty weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p>\n<h3>Reload 20</h3>\n<p>A number of shots equal to the reload number can be made with a weapon with this property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (their choice). You must have one free hand to reload.</p>\n<h3>Two-handed</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property requires two hands to use.</p>",
