      "value": "<p>Choose a power of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that power—called the contingent power—as part of casting contingency, expending power slots for both, but the contingent power doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two powers. For example, a contingency cast with water breathing might stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.</p><p>The contingent power takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to. and then contingency ends.</p><p>The contingent power takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency power at a time. If you cast this power again, the effect of another contingency power on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.</p>",
