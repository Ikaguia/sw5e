      "value": "<h3>Defensive 1</h3>\n<p>When you make your first attack on your turn with a weapon with the defensive property, you can choose to suffer a penalty to attack and damage rolls with that weapon up to the defensive number. If you do so, you gain the same bonus to AC. These effects last until the start of your next turn, as long as you're holding the weapon.</p>\n<h3>Dexterity 13</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property requires more skill to control. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Dexterity requirement. </p>\n<h3>Heavy</h3>\n<p>When you hit with an attack roll using Strength with a weapon with this property, you deal additional damage equal to half your Strength modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\n<h3>Luminous</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius while activated. Additionally, Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while the weapon is activated have disadvantage.</p>\n<h3>Versatile ([[/r 1d10]])</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.\t</p>",
