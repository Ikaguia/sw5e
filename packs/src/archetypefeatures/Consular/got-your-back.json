If either of you do so, the other of the two of you gains advantage on the save. You can use this feature before or after you both make the saving throw, but you must do so before the GM says whether the save succeeds or fails.</p>\n<p>At 17th level, your companion must be within 60 feet of you to benefit from this feature. </p>",
