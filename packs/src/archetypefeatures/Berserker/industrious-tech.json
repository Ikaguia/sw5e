While raging, you add your rage damage to damage rolls from tech powers you cast that require a tech attack or saving throw. If a tech power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of them. </p>\n<p>Casting tech powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage, and you can use your Reckless Attack feature to gain advantage when casting a tech power that requires a tech attack.</p>",
