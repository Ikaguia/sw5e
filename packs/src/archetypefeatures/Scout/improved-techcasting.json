You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.</p>\n<h3>Improved Tech Points</h3>\n<p>You have a number of tech points equal to one and a half times your scout level, instead of your scout level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the Mechanist Technique Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Improved Max Power Level</h3>\n<p>Your Max Power Level becomes 2nd, instead of 1st, and it increases at higher levels, as shown in the Mechanist Technique Techcasting table.</p>\n<p>You may only cast tech powers at 5th, 6th, and 7th-level once, instead of 4th and 5th. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>",
