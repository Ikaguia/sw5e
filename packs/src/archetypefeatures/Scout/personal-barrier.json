      "value": "<p><em><strong>Bulwark Technique:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>You gain access to a powerful personal barrier. Whenever you complete a short or long rest, you create a barrier on yourself that lasts until you finish a short or long rest. That barrier has hit points equal to twice your scout level + your Intelligence modifier. Your barrier can never have hit points greater than twice your scout level + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>Whenever you take damage, the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.</p>\n<p>While the barrier has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its power remains. Whenever you cast a tech power of 1st level or higher, your barrier regains hit points equal to the number of tech points spent.</p>\n<p>Additionally, for as long as your barrier has hit points, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are considered proficient in Constitution saving throws for the purpose of maintaining concentration on tech powers.</li>\n<li>Hostile creatures that hit you with melee attacks take energy damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</li></ul>",
