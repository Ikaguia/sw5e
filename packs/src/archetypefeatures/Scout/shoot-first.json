      "value": "<p><em><strong>Deadeye Technique:</strong> 11th, 13th, and 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You have learned that the person who shoots first is often the one who walks out alive. When you make a ranged weapon attack against a creature that has not yet acted during your first turn in combat and you have advantage on the roll, you can reroll one of the dice once. Additionally, on a hit, you deal an extra [[/r 1d8]] damage of the same type as the weapon. This damage increases to [[/r 1d10]] at 13th level and [[/r 1d12]] at 17th level.</p>",
