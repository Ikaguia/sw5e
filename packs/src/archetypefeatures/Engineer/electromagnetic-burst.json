Each must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes [[/r 14d6]] ion damage and is stunned until the start of your next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't stunned.</p>\n<h3>Jamming Burst</h3>\n<p>Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that are within 60 feet. Once in the next minute, when a chosen creature fails a saving throw caused by a tech power or is hit by an attack power, the creature can choose to succeed on the saving throw or have the attack miss instead.</p>\n<h3>Targeting Burst</h3>\n<p>Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that are within 60 feet. Each creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC or be blinded for [[/r 1d4+1]] turns. </p>",
