      "value": "<p><em><strong>Chef Pursuit:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You have developed a signature feast that is the purest distillation of your knowledge and talent as a chef.</p>\n<p>Over the course of a long rest, you can expend rare culinary supplies worth 1,000 cr to create your feast, which can feed a number of creatures equal to twice your Critical Analysis ability modifer. Any creature partaking in the feast gains the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is cured of all poisons and disease, and becomes immune to poison and disease.</li>\n<li>It makes Wisdom saving throws to avoid being frightened with advantage.</li>\n<li>Its hit point maximum and current hit points increase by [[/r 2d10]].</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These benefits last until the end of the creature's next long rest or 24 hours have passed. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>",
