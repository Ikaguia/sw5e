      "value": "<p><em><strong>Lethality Practice:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>When you hit a creature that you are hidden from with a weapon attack, you can choose to turn that hit into a critical hit. If the attack reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it does not automatically reveal your presence to any remaining creatures. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the creatures' Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, you remain hidden. If you would already be able to make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to remain hidden as part of the attack, you instead gain advantage on the check.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature once. You gain an additional use at 9th and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>",
