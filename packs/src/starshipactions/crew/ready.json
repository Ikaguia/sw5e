      "value": "<p>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn so that you can act later in the round using your reaction.</p>\n<p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger. For instance, \"When the enemy appears, I'll fire my railgun at it.\"</p>\n<p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.</p>",
