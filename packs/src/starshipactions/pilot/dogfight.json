      "value": "<p>When you take the Dogfight action, you engage an enemy, ducking and weaving, vying for a good shot while avoiding theirs. You choose a target you can see and make an opposed Dexterity (Maneuver) check. On a success, you cause the next attack made against your ship by the target to suffer from disadvantage, but you grant the next attack made against your ship by a different target advantage. Additionally, you can perform a primary or tertiary weapon attack from a forward-facing limited firing arc against that ship without suffering the normal disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Only a deployed pilot can take the Dogfight action.</p>",
