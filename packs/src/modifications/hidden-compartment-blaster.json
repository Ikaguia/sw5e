You cannot use this hidden blaster until it is revealed. As a bonus action, you can reveal this weapon and make a single ranged weapon attack with it. You have proficiency with this weapon for this attack. It deals [[/r 1d4]] energy damage on a hit, has a range of 20/60, and the light and reload 4 properties.</p>\n<p><strong>Side Effect:</strong> Reloading this weapon takes longer than usual. You can reload and re-conceal this weapon over one hour, which can be done during a short rest. This hidden compartment can only fit the specific blaster with which it is paired.</p>\n<p><em>This augmentation hides a weapon in its wearer's forearm that is almost completely undetectable by modern sensors.</em></p>",
