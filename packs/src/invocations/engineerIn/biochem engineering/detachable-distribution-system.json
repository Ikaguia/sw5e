      "value": "<p>You upgrade your distributor with a secondary, detachable distributor. As a bonus action, you can throw your detachable distributor at a point within range. Your detachable distributor has a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. Your detachable distributor works for 1 minute before coming inert. Once it does so, you can't use it again until you recover it as an action.</p>\n<p>Additionally, while your detachable distributor is within 100 feet of you, when you use your action to activate your distributor, you can choose to affect each creature within 5 feet of your detachable distributor. You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>",
