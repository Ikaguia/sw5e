When you deal cold damage with a tech power or class feature, you can use your Biochemist's Touch and Potent Mixture features.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when a creature fails their Constitution saving throw against your Noxious Mixtures feature, you can choose to instead deal cold damage. If you do so, it gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>",
