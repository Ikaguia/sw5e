You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creatures have disadvantage on damage rolls from opportunity attacks they make that hit you, and you have advantage on damage roll for opportunity attacks you make that hit.</li>\n<li>When you roll a die to reduce the damage you take from a weapon, you have advantage on the die roll.</li>\n<li>Once per round, when a creature provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can choose to gain a special reaction which you can only use to make that opportunity attack. If you do so, you make the opportunity attack without the aid of your proficiency bonus.</li>\n<li>When you would be the target of a weapon attack, you can immediately use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against the target without your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and you impose disadvantage on the triggering roll.</li></ul>",
