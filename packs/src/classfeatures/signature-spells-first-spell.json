Choose two 3rd-level wizard powers in your powerbook as your signature powers. You always have these powers prepared, they don't count against the number of powers you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a power slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>If you want to cast either power at a higher level, you must expend a power slot as normal.</p><p>If you wish, manually edit this entry and make a note of your first choice here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>First power choice</em></li>\n</ul>",
