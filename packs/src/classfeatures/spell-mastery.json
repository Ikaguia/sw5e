Choose a 1st-level wizard power and a 2nd-level wizard power that are in your powerbook. You can cast those powers at their lowest level without expending a power slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either power at a higher level, you must expend a power slot as normal.</p><p>By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the powers you chose for different powers of the same levels.</p><p>If you wish, manually edit this entry and make a note of your choices here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>1st level power</em></li>\n<li><em>2nd level power</em></li>\n</ul>",
