Choose one 6th-level power from the warlock power list as this arcanum.</p><p>You can cast your arcanum power once without expending a power slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p><p>At higher levels, you gain more warlock powers of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level power at 13th level, one 8th-level power at 15th level, and one 9th-level power at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.</p><p>If you wish, manually edit this entry and make a note of your choice here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>6th-level power</em></li>\n</ul>",
