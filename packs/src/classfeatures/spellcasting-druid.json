      "value": "<p>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast powers to shape that essence to your will.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid power list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\n<h3>Preparing and Casting Powers</h3>\n<p>The Druid table shows how many power slots you have to cast your powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid powers, you must expend a slot of the power's level or higher. You regain all expended power slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of druid powers that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid power list. When you do so, choose a number of druid powers equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one power). The powers must be of a level for which you have power slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level power slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared powers can include six powers of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level power cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the power doesn't remove it from your list of prepared powers.</p><p>You can also change your list of prepared powers when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid powers requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per power level for each power on your list.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Level</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Cantrips Known</td>\n<td colspan=\"9\">-Power Slots per Power Level-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Powercasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Wisdom is your powercasting ability for your druid powers, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature.
