      "value": "<h4>Weapon (Net)</h4>\n <p>A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on formless or Huge or larger creatures. A creature can use its action to make a DC 14 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has an AC of 11, 10 hit points, immunity to all damage not dealt by melee weapons, and resistance to damage dealt by unenhanced melee weapons. Destroying the net frees the creature without harming it and immediately ends the net's effects. While a creature is restrained by a net, you can make no further attacks with it.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Net</h2>\n<h3>Light</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when engaging in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting. See the rules for Double- and Two-Weapon Fighting in chapter 9.</p>\n<h3>Finesse</h3>\n<p>When making an attack with a weapon with this property, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p>\n<h3>Thrown (range 15)</h3>\n<p>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has this property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p>\n<h3>Special</h3>\n<p>A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on formless or Huge or larger creatures. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has an AC of 10, 5 hit points, and immunity to all damage not dealt by melee weapons. Destroying the net frees the creature without harming it and immediately ends the net's effects. While a creature is restrained by a net, you can make no further attacks with it.</p>",
