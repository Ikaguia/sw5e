      "value": "<p>Also at 1st tier, your starship gains the ability to automatically mitigate damage from ships.</p>\n<p>Once per turn, as a reaction to being dealt damage by a ship weapon, a crew member can use their reaction and roll a Damage Control die, which is a d4, and subtract it from the damage roll.</p>\n<p>Your ship&rsquo;s Damage Control die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.</p>\n<p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to 4 x your ship&rsquo;s tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting.</p>",
