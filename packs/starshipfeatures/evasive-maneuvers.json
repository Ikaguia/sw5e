      "value": "<p>Also at 1st tier, when a deployed pilot rolls for initiative, they can immediately move the ship. This movement happens before the initiative order is determined.</p>\n<p>The amount the ship moves is determined by rolling an Evasive Maneuvers die, which is a d4, and multiplying it by 50 feet. The ship then gains that many feet that it can move or spend to turn.</p>\n<p>Your ship&rsquo;s Evasive Maneuvers die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.</p>\n<p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to 2 x your ship&rsquo;s tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.</p>",
