      "value": "<p>Also at 1st tier, your starship gains the ability to react to damage from large ships.</p>\n<p>As a reaction to being hit with an attack roll from a Large or larger ship, a deployed pilot can use their reaction to immediately move the ship forward an amount equal to half its flying speed (rounded down) and then roll a Blockade Runner die, which is a d4, and subtract it from the triggering attack roll, potentially causing it to miss.</p>\n<p>Your ship&rsquo;s Blockade Runner die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.</p>\n<p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to 3 x your ship&rsquo;s tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.</p>",
