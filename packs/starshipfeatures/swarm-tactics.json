      "value": "<p>Also at 1st tier, your starship is most effective when working in groups.</p><p>Your ship makes the most of every opportunity provided by allies. When a crew member at the helm would make an attack roll against a larger ship, and there is an allied ship within 200 feet of your target, they can roll a Swarm Tactics die, which is a [[/r 1d4]], and add it to the attack roll. You can do this after the roll is made, but before the result is known.</p><p>Your ship's Swarm Tactics die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a [[/r 1d6]] at 2nd tier, a [[/r 1d6]] at 3rd tier, a [[/r 1d10]] at 4th tier and a [[/r 1d12]] at 5th tier.</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to 2 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.</p>",
