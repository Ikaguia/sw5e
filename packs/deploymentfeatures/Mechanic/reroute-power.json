A power coupling can be toggled to neutral, where all three aspects function normally, or can divert power to a specific system.</p><p>When diverting power to a system, the effects of that system are doubled:</p><ul><li><strong>Engines:</strong> A ship's flying speed is doubled.</li><li><strong>Shields:</strong> Shields take half damage and shield regeneration rate is doubled.</li><li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Weapons deal double damage.</li></ul><p>When diverting power to a system, power to the other systems is halved:</p><ul><li><strong>Engines:</strong> A ship's flying speed is reduced by half.</li><li><strong>Shields:</strong> Shields take double damage and shield regeneration rate reduced by half.</li><li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Ship weapon damage is reduced by half.</li></ul>",
